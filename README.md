iCore PHP CMS/Framework
===================

Notice!!!
---------
Currently it is under construction, no product version is valid.

What's This?
------------
iCore is a php framework/CMS for fast website building and for future (good for html5,php5.4 etc) by [yarco][me].
It is something like drupal, but small and simple.

It begins from 2007 (maybe, i forget), a simple php framework called Coto. But it was never really used.
When touch drupal, the idea of a "simple drupal" comes up. But it still remains a hard work.
After finish a simple project, i merged all together. That is the framework you see, or you can call it "iCore CMS".

How To Use?
---------------
1. download
2. put files under public/ into your webroot, and other files to somewhere without web access permissions.
3. customize index.php under your webroot to suit your needs (DEFAULTS, and the path to common.php).
4. visit your website to install
